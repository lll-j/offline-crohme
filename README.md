# offline-CROHME
Converting CROHME dataset for Online-handwritting text recognition to Offline-handwritting text recognition.

## What is offline-CROHME?
**offline-CROHME** is a tool for converting [CROHME](https://www.isical.ac.in/~crohme/) to Offline-handwritting text recognition dataset. 

## What is CROHME?
The dataset provides more than 12 000 expressions handwritten by hundreds of writers from different countries, merging the data sets from 4 previous CROHME competitions and adding new ressources. Writers were asked to copy printed expressions from a corpus of expressions. The corpus has been designed to cover the diversity proposed by the different tasks and chosen from an existing math corpus and from expressions embedded in Wikipedia pages. Different devices have been used (different digital pen technologies, white-board input device, tablet with sensible screen), thus different scales and resolutions are used. The dataset provides only the on-line signal.
